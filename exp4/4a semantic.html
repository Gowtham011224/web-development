NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) team on Monday dealt a 
major blow after their skipper KL Rahul suffered a thigh muscle
injury on his right leg during their Indian Premier League (IPL)

The incident happened during the last ball of the second 
over when RCB captain Faf du Plessis went for a drive 
towards wide of cover and Rahul gave it a good chase before 
pulling up his thigh muscle just before the boundary rope. 
Rahul immediately fell on the ground grimacing in pain as
