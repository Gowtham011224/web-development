<p><b>about pets</b></p>
A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a
person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal
or a laboratory animal.
<br>Pets are often considered to have attractive/cute
appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities,
<br>but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal)
and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
